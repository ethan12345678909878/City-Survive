        <div class="box2" >When i first decided to make my game a city theme the idea was from i song i like called seoul, the song name comes from the city seoul from south korea, the cover picture for the song is a dark ally in seoul that is made brighter by all the neon signs. It is one of my favourate cover pictures for any song of all time and i wanted to base my game around the idea of it. As i have based my game around a seoul and its alleys in my game other then the three main city roads the rest of he map is all alley ways that connects these main roads together just like how they do in real life and down the alley ways will be bright neon signs. <P> The mood board shows my ideas i origninally had for the game and what i wanted for the game to look like i orginally wanted it to be you have to make it from a arrive at the objective game to a collect all of the papers game and the thugs have changed slightly as i couldnt find a good thug i liked so i changed the idea of them so they are clones that have gone rouge and are not thugs anymore </P>  </div>
