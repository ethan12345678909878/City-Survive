        <div class="box2" >  This is the game description page, on this page i will give you a over view of the game and what i have done to it to make it how it is. The game its self is called "City Survive" the idea of the game is that you have had a busy day and your boss has sent you out into the city to collect pages that he has lost. However the city is a dangerous place and thugs have found these pages and are holding them hostage in hopes of a reward, what they forget is that this is America and everyone carries a gun and you must get those pages back or the boss has thretened to kill your family so its either you or them.
          <p> The charater you play as - You play as a family man who has a boring city job working in a office, he does his job for his family so they dont starve as its a hard life living in the city. You have a wife and a daughter who you will do anything to protect and keep safe. You are a loyal man but when it comes to your family you are also a killer.</p>
          <p> The thugs in the game - as you play this game you will notice that all of them look the same that is because they are a science experiment that has gone seriously wrong, the idea behind them is that that they were meant to be servants that would abide by there masters without question but now thy dont listen to anyone and are full of rage. They will attack and kill onsite so dont feel bad killing them as they wont feel bad killing you.</p>
