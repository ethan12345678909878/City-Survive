        <div class="box2" > Hello this is my website for my game "City Survive" in this website you will find out all that has gone into the making of my game, from the ealiest stages with my ideas all the way to the coding and designing of the game. I have a veriaity of pages in this website, this includes and page dedicated to the lore of the game, a page dedicated to the creaton of the game and another one about our contact info so you can get in touch if you wish to be apart of the game . <P> The whole reason i am making this game is beacause for one of the units for my college course we were told we would have to design model and create a game by ourselfs which if you have been following me since last year you would know that we in groups of 4 and created the game "The New Plauge" this year however we had to make the game all by ourselfs which at the beggining of the year sounded really hard but after a while you get into a rhythm and the game is not as hard as you think to make.  </P> </div>
